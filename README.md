# Info
I would like to find a place to live longer term. 

## What do I want? 

Things that are important to me in priority order with priority ranking. 10s are non negotiable, anything lower I could compromise with, but would rather not. 
* to live somewhere that I can do everything needed in my daily life without interacting with cars (10)
* people in my peer group to live in same city or train away (10)
* minimal smoking (9) 
* trains that can be used to get to other cities (8)
* English or Spanish (8)
* good weather year long (6)
* a decent airport nearby for long distance travel (6)
* lots of good veggie food places (4)

Price doesn't matter. Altho cheaper is better given all other things equal. 

## What do I not want? 
* I do not want to hear traffic or see cars in my daily life. When traveling outside my area interacting with them would be acceptable though
* I do not want to live in a very small town
