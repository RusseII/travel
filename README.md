# What do I want? 

Things that are important to me in priority order with priority ranking. 10s are non negotiable, anything lower I could compromise with, but would rather not. 
* to live somewhere that I can do everything needed in my daily life without interacting with cars. (10)
* people in my peer group to live in same city or train away (10)
* trains that can be used to get to other cities (8)
* English or Spanish (8)
* good weather year long (6)
* a decent airport nearby for long distance travel (6)

Price doesn't matter. Altho cheaper is better given all other things equal.
